# geobr: Download Official Spatial Data Sets of Brazil

<p align="justify">
geobr is a computational package to download official spatial data sets
of Brazil. The package covers a wide range of spatial data sets,
available at various geographic scales and for various years with
harmonized attributes, projection and fixed topology (see detailed list
of available data sets below).
</p>

The package is currently available in **R** and **Python**.

## Installation R

``` r
# Install the development version from GitHub
utils::remove.packages('geobr')
remotes::install_github("yan-fab/geobr", subdir = "r-package")
```

obs. If you use **Linux**, you need to install a couple dependencies
before installing the libraries `sf` and `geobr`. [More info
here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#linux).

## Installation Python

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yan-fab/geobr.git#subdirectory=python-package
```

*Windows users:*

``` bash
conda create -n geo_env
conda activate geo_env  
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge  
conda config --env --set channel_priority strict  
conda install python=3 geopandas  
pip install git+https://github.com/yan-fab/geobr.git#subdirectory=python-package
```

# Basic Usage

The syntax of all `geobr` functions operate on the same logic so it
becomes intuitive to download any data set using a single line of code.
Like this:

## R, reading the data as an `sf` object

``` r
library(geobr)

# Read specific municipality at a given year
mun <- read_municipality(code_muni = 1200179, year = 2022)

# Read all municipalities of given state at a given year
mun <- read_municipality(code_muni = "RJ", year = 2022) # or
mun <- read_municipality(code_muni = 33, year = 2022)

# Read all municipalities in the country at a given year
mun <- read_municipality(code_muni="all", year = 2022)
```

## Python, reading the data as a `geopandas` object

``` python
from geobr import read_municipality

# Read specific municipality at a given year
mun = read_municipality(code_muni=1200179, year=2017)

# Read all municipalities of given state at a given year
mun = read_municipality(code_muni=33, year=2010) # or
mun = read_municipality(code_muni="RJ", year=2010)

# Read all municipalities in the country at a given year
mun = read_municipality(code_muni="all", year=2018)
```
